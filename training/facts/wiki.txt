Nakhleh was born on May 8, 1974, to a Christian, Palestinian family in Israel. He currently lives with his Japanese wife and two children in Texas, and holds both U.S. and Israeli citizenship.

Nakhleh did his undergraduate studies in the Department of Computer Science at the [[Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]], Israel Institute of Technology, earning a bachelor's degree in 1996. He earned a master's degree in Computer Science from [[Texas A&M University]] in 1998, and a PhD degree in Computer Science from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], under the supervision of Prof. [[Tandy Warnow]], in 2004. Nakhleh started his academic position at Rice University in July 2004, and became a Full Professor in 2016.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}  He served as the J.S. Abercrombie Professor of Computer Science from July 2018 until December 2020.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cs.rice.edu/news/nakhleh-vargas-named-endowed-chairs | title=Nakhleh, Vargas named endowed chairs | date=July 3, 2018 | publisher=Rice University Department of Computer Science}}</ref> Nakhleh served as Chair of the Computer Science Department at Rice University from 2017 to 2020.

In addition to his duties as the Dean of Engineering at Rice University, Nakhleh currently teaches courses in discrete mathematics and [[computational biology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Luay K.

Nakhleh's research has been focused mainly on computational and statistical approaches to phylogenomics and [[comparative genomics]] under 
scenarios where the evolutionary history of the genomes is not treelike. His earlier work in this area focused on parsimonious [[phylogenetic network]]s: networks that embed a given set of trees with the lowest number of reticulations, assuming all gene tree incongruence is due to [[reticulate evolution]]. He and his colleagues also applied similar approaches to language data to elucidate the (reticulate) 
evolutionary history of the [[Indo-European languages]]. Their paper on perfect phylogenetic networks was included as one of the 20 best papers published in Language, the flagship journal of the Linguistic Society of America, in the 30-year period 1986-2016.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Best of Language: Volume III {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/best-language-volume-iii|access-date=2021-04-30|website=www.linguisticsociety.org}}</ref>

Later, his work started focusing on statistical approaches, in order to account for other evolutionary processes that could be at play in genomic data sets, most notably [[incomplete lineage sorting]]. These approaches could be viewed as approximations of the multispecies [[Coalescent theory|coalescent]] with gene flow.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Additionally, Nakhleh has done research on biological networks (modeling and evolution) and, more recently, on computational questions arising in cancer genomics.

Nakhleh and his group have been developing PhyloNet, an open-source software package, implemented in Java, for inference and analysis of (explicit) phylogenetic networks.
